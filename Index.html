They can only be ridden by experienced and highly skilled surfers, they only break in perfect XXL conditions, and they can take the life of a professional big wave surfer in a split second.

And what do <span style= "color: red;"> Garrett McNamara, Laird Hamilton, Shane Dorian, Mark Foo, Grant Baker, Eddie Aikau, Jeff Clark, Ross Clarke-Jones, Mike Parsons, Greg Long, Ken Bradshaw, and Maya Gabeira </span> have in common?

<br/><br/>They all share the same passion for chasing the largest winter swells and riding the biggest and heaviest waves in the world.

Big wave surfing is nearly a sport within itself. It is addictive and creates adrenaline junkies.

Let's put things in perspective.

In a 15-second swell period scenario, a 50-foot wave (15 meters) carries about 1.7 MW of power across each meter of a wavefront.

As a result, surfing huge waves can be a death sentence for those without the knowledge, physical and mental training, and experience in extreme spots and adverse weather conditions.

A little dose of courage and commitment is always welcome because there's just too much at stake.

The risk of losing your family and friends forever is a strong variable in an equation that features a human being challenging Mother Nature's will.

In other words, safety procedures and professionalism might not be enough to survive unexpected events in high surf.

In big wave surfing, time and timing are two different things. <div> There's a time to paddle hard and go for it, and then there's the stand-up timing.</div>

If you've decided to surf the biggest wave of your life, there are a few things you should know.

First of all, be prepared in all the dimensions that come with it. Then, get the right surf gear, book a jet ski, and find boat support.

Finally, decide if you're paddling into the wave or getting towed into a giant mountain of moving water.

The biggest waves in the world can be found and ridden across all continents. With the right swell and wind conditions, you might be lucky enough to ride a couple of monstrous waves.

Carefully selecting which wave will open its face and the right moment for the take-off is compulsory. A subtle mistake could be disastrous.

Some of the most dangerous and extreme surf breaks on the planet come to life dozens or even hundreds of miles offshore in the open ocean and can only be reached by boat or helicopter.
